# Template for running an sbatch arrayjob with a file containing a list of
# commands to run. Copy this, remove the .template, and edit as you wish to
# fit your needs.
#
# Assuming this file has been edited and renamed slurm_arrayjob.sh, here's an
# example usage:
# ```
# EXPT_FILE=experiments.txt  # <- this has a command to run on each line
# NR_EXPTS=`cat ${EXPT_FILE} | wc -l`
# MAX_PARALLEL_JOBS=12
# sbatch --array=1-${NR_EXPTS}%${MAX_PARALLEL_JOBS} array_track_video.sh $EXPT_FILE
# ```
#
# or, equivalently and as intended, with provided `run_experiment`:
# ```
# run_experiment -b array_track_video.sh -e experiments.txt -m 12
# ```

# Make your own folder on the node's scratch disk
# N.B. disk could be at /disk/scratch_big, or /disk/scratch_fast. Check
# yourself using an interactive session, or check the docs:
#     http://computing.help.inf.ed.ac.uk/cluster-computing

# =================================
# Move input data to scratch disk
# =================================
# Move data from a source location, probably on the distributed filesystem
# (DFS), to the scratch space on the selected node. Your code should read and
# write data on the scratch space attached directly to the compute node (i.e.
# not distributed), *not* the DFS. Writing/reading from the DFS is extremely
# slow because the data must stay consistent on *all* nodes. This constraint
# results in much network traffic and waiting time for you!
#
# This example assumes you have a folder containing all your input data on the
# DFS, and it copies all that data  file to the scratch space, and unzips it.
#
# For more guidelines about moving files between the distributed filesystem and
# the scratch space on the nodes, see:
#     http://computing.help.inf.ed.ac.uk/cluster-tips

echo "Moving input data to the compute node's scratch space: $SCRATCH_DISK"

project_name=sleap
# input data directory path on the DFS
dfs_input_path=/home/${USER}/${project_name}/data/input

# input data directory path on the scratch disk of the node
scratch_input_path=${SCRATCH_HOME}/${project_name}/data/input
mkdir -p ${scratch_input_path}  # make it if required

# Important notes about rsync:
# * the --compress option is going to compress the data before transfer to send
#   as a stream. THIS IS IMPORTANT - transferring many files is very very slow
# * the final slash at the end of ${src_path}/ is important if you want to send
#   its contents, rather than the directory itself. For example, without a
#   final slash here, we would create an extra directory at the destination:
#       ${SCRATCH_HOME}/project_name/data/input/input
# * for more about the (endless) rsync options, see the docs:
#       https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.html

# ==============================
# Finally, run the experiment!
# ==============================
# Read line number ${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID} from the experiment file and run it
# ${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID} is simply the number of the job within the array. If
# you execute `sbatch --array=1:100 ...` the jobs will get numbers 1 to 100
# inclusive.
